Project Bird Racing is an online world where players can breed, raise and care for the local bird like creatures called avions and race them in both local and national races. 

## Premise

The game is set in a world called Silva ('forest' in Latin) which is inhabited by avions (bird like creatures), the native form of animal life. Your role as the player is to raise and breed avions to race in national events and maintain the top spot in the leader boards.

## Game Play

This is an MMO, client/server game. Multiple players connect to the server to join the world. The main goal of the game is the breed and race the fastest avion.

Players can explore the world, setup a home in one of the many villages; mine materials; farm land; capture, care for, breed and race avions.

### Silva

Silva is Latin for forest. This name was chosen as forests are typically home to many varieties of birds.

Silva is a large world that players can explore. It acts as a "world map", containing villages, forests, oceans, mountains, caves and wild avions.

Players explore Silva to accomplish the game's goals. There are two main modes of travel - walking and riding an avion.

### Setting up a Home

### Farming Land

### Avions

The native animal life in Silva are avions. They are bird like creatures that can walk, fly and swim.

Avions have various attributes:

* Color
* Speed
* Stamina
* Agility
* Health

#### In the Wild

#### Being Captured

#### Being Cared For

#### Breeding

Avions can breed to create other avions. Each time they breed, an egg may be layed. The child avion will inherit some of the attributes from its parents using a genetic algorithm.

Breeding may or may not be successful. Success is dependent on overall fitness and health.

Players can breed avions they are raising. Avions in the wild will also breed.
