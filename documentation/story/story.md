Project Bird Racing is an online world where players can breed, raise and care for the local bird like creatures called avions and race them in both local and national races.

## Premise

The game is set in a world called Silva ('forest' in Latin) which is inhabited by avions (bird like creatures), the native form of animal life. Your role as the player is to raise and breed avions to race in national events and maintain the top spot in the leader boards.

## Game Play

This is an MMO, client/server game. Multiple players connect to the server to join the world. The main goal of the game is the breed and race the fastest avion.

Players can explore the world, setup a home in one of the many villages; mine materials; farm land; capture, care for, breed and race avions.

### Silva

Silva is Latin for forest. This name was chosen as forests are typically home to many varieties of birds.

Silva is a large, randomly generated, 3D world that players can explore. It acts as a "world map", containing villages, forests, oceans, mountains, caves and wild avions. The player has a minimap to assist with exploring the world.

Players explore Silva to accomplish the game's goals. There are two main modes of travel - walking and riding an avion.

Villages are shown on the world as village model. When a player walks into the village model, the player is transported into the actual village.

### Time

Time progresses in Silva. With time, crops grow and avion age.

### Setting up a Home

### Mining Materials

### Farming Land

### Avions

The native animal life in Silva are avions. They are bird like creatures that can walk, fly and swim.

Avions have various attributes:

- Color
- Speed
- Stamina
- Agility
- Health
- Hunger
- Lifespan
- Age
  - As the age increases, the attributes are negatively affected

They also have a level and experience points. Each time an avion wins a race, it gains experience points. Once a certain number of experience points are gained, the avion levels up. When it levels up, its attributes also increase.

#### Levels and Experience Points

The experience given to the winner of a race depends on the levels of the other avions in the race. The higher the levels, the more experience given.

#### In the Wild

Native avions live in the wild. They eat, breed, live, grow and die.

#### Being Captured

Player's can capture wild avions. When captured, they can be raised, bred and raced by the player.

Avions are captured by challenging them to a race. If the race is won, the avion will come under the control of the player.

#### Being Cared For

As time passes, hunger and stamina increases. Age and health also decrease.

Avions must be fed for hunger to go down. Rest and medicine must be given for their health to increase.

If age reaches lifespan, the avion dies.

#### Breeding

Avions can breed to create other avions. Each time they breed, an egg may be layed. The child avion will inherit some of the attributes from its parents using a genetic algorithm.

Breeding may or may not be successful. Success is dependent on level, health and age.

Players can breed avions they are raising. Avions in the wild will also breed.

### Racing

Racing is a core component of life in Silva. All inhabitants and avions live and breathe for racing. There are informal races between people for fun and challenge, official races setup by authorities with national leader boards and challenge races when people try and capture an avion.

Avions race on official tracks or in the wild, in commonly run courses. The first avion to cross the finish line wins. Players are in control of the avion as it races. NPC avions are controlled by AI.

As avions race, their stamina decreases. Race tracks have stamina boosting nuts along it. When an avion runs into the nut, its stamina increases by an amount indicated by the nut.

#### Informal Races

#### National Races

Eight avions are required per race.

#### Challenge Races

#### Stamina Boosting Nuts
